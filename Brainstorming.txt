Thinking about organization:

hidden markov model

*Components
---states
---symbols
---transition matrix
---emission probabilities per state
---initial state probabilities (represented as state 0).
---manhattan graph or trellis graph or lattice for Viterbi/forward-backward and Baum-Wlech algorithm 

*Question 1: Given a model and probability of being in each state, what is the probability that the next symbol is b?
P( x_{t+1} = b ) = \sum_{s \in States} { P(\pi_{t}  = s) * p(x_{t+1} = b | \pi_{t} = s) }
*Question 2: Compute the accuracy of guessing the symbol across a large sequence. Is the method accurate?
