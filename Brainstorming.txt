Thinking about organization:

hidden markov model

*Components
---states
---symbols
---transition matrix
---emission probabilities per state
---initial state probabilities (represented as state 0).
---manhattan graph or trellis graph or lattice for Viterbi/forward-backward and Baum-Wlech algorithm 

*Question 1: Given a model and probability of being in each state, what is the probability that the next symbol is b?
P( x_{t+1} = b ) = \sum_{s \in States} { P(\pi_{t}  = s) P(x_{t+1} = b | \pi_{t} = s) }
*Question 2: Compute the accuracy of guessing the symbol across a large sequence. Is the method accurate?


For lotto:

(1) implement fair biased coin model and check and see if we can correctly esitmate the parameters of this model
(2) How many training examples do we need to correctly fit the model?
(3) How many previous days to we need to accurately predict the state on the day before we play?
